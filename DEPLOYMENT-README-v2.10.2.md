## üîß **What's Fixed in This Version**

### ‚úÖ **Major Fix: School District Fields Restored**

**Issue:** School district fields were accidentally removed from `/api/property-search-new` endpoint in recent commits.

**Root Cause:** The property response mapping was missing school district field mappings, even though the raw MLS data contained all school information.

**Fix Applied:** Restored school district fields to the property search response:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ SCHOOL DISTRICT FIELDS RESTORED:
schoolElementary: prop.ElementarySchool || "",
schoolElementaryDistrict: prop.ElementarySchoolDistrict || "",
schoolMiddle: prop.MiddleOrJuniorSchool || "",
schoolMiddleDistrict: prop.MiddleOrJuniorSchoolDistrict || prop.MiddleSchoolDistrict || "",
schoolHigh: prop.HighSchool || "",
schoolHighDistrict: prop.HighSchoolDistrict || "",
```
