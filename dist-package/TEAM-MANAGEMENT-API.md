## üöÄ **Deployment Information**

- **Production URL:** `https://gbcma.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com`
- **Local Development:** `http://localhost:3002`
- **AWS Deployment:** Elastic Beanstalk
- **Data Storage:** In-memory (production should use database)

### **Deployment Package:**

- `gbcma-team-management-backend-2025-09-05.zip`
- Contains all team management APIs
- Ready for AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment

---

## üí° **Integration Notes**

### **For Frontend Applications:**

1. All endpoints return consistent JSON responses with `success` boolean
2. Use `teamId` and `memberId` for all operations
3. Team properties are automatically prioritized in featured listings
4. Error responses include descriptive messages for user feedback
5. Agent MLS IDs are used for property matching

### **Priority System:**

1. **Team Properties First** - Properties where list agent is a team member
2. **Other Properties** - All other matching properties (when `include_others=true`)

### **Data Persistence:**

- Current implementation uses in-memory storage
- For production, integrate with database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Team and member data will reset on server restart
